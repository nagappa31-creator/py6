📌 README.md

# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website

This is a simple **portfolio website** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — all combined in a single file.  
It contains an About section, Projects section, and a Contact Form with a JavaScript message popup.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Fully responsive single-page layout  
- Clean and modern card design  
- Smooth navigation  
- Contact form with JavaScript-based success message  
- No external CSS or JS files (all combined together)

## 📁 Project Structure

portfolio.html   ← (All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in one file)

Just one file — easy to run and share.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Page structure  
- **CSS3** – Styles and layout  
- **JavaScript** – Contact form interaction  

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Download or copy the `portfolio.html` file.
2. Double-click to open it in any web browser  
   *(Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)*
3. No installation or server is required.

## 📬 Contact Form Behavior

The form does **not** send messages to a server.  
Instead, a JavaScript function displays a success message:

Thanks <your name>! Your message has been received.

This keeps the project simple and beginner-friendly.
